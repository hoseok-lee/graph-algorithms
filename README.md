# graph-algorithms
Python implementation of graph optimisation algorithms (Kruskal, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, and Bellman-Ford) using a personal graph data structure. Some of the algorithms include implementation of path reconstruction and negative-weight cycle recognition. 

The included *exercise.py* file demonstrates how to instantiate a graph, call the algorithms, and properly catch negative-weight cycles.

*Please note that these graph algorithms have not been fully optimized. They were made solely for functionality.*
